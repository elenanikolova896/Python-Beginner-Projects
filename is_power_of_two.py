This code defines a Python function called is_power_of_two that checks whether a given number is a power of two. 

def is_power_of_two(number):
    if number <= 0:
        return False  # If the number is non-positive, it cannot be a power of two.
    
    while number % 2 == 0:
        number = number / 2  # Continuously divide the number by 2 while it's even.
        if number == 1:
            return True  # If the number becomes 1, it's a power of two.
    return False  # If the loop finishes without reaching 1, it's not a power of two.
